# Prototype PoC

The aim of this project is to develop a testing environment for the key concepts we have created. By using a prototype, we aim to further develop our MVP by exploring key functions, understanding the key user experience concerns through real data and partially real users (internal team members), and demonstrating the potential of our ideas.

# Epic Overview

The overarching goal is to allow internal users, who have recognizable IDs, and the ability to switch between "zombie accounts," to perform simple tasks such as posting, commenting, upvoting/downvoting, and using their allocated credits for each account.

This epic is broken down into two stories:

1. The development team will create the prototype and improve its functions by integrating frontend and backend components, testing potential technologies, and creating a preliminary data structure.
2. The content/community team will use the system to post existing content and evaluate its functions to ensure they can perform basic actions and provide personal feedback.

# Implementation Methodology

To create this prototype, we will use a simple user experience design based on the Product Definition Spec and the epic description. We will take inspiration from modern content publishing UIs and implement these designs using code. Once the prototype is complete, it will be deployed on a remote server under the domain name "0.here.news" and made available for internal use only.

As we will continue to evolve the system from this key milestone, all experimental data from the proof of concept will be retained and integrated into the future system. Some trims and prunes may occur, but the majority of the work done in the proof of concept phase will not be wasted.
